## Introduction

This is my submission to the [Perdoo Code Challenge](https://www.notion.so/Full-Stack-Web-Engineer-Case-Study-1df14966419740c2baf95461c04458c8).

## Stack

This project was built using the following stack:

- NextJS 14 (with app directory)
- React
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Shadcn/ui for the primitives UI components
- Lucide.dev for the icons
- Apollo Client for fetching data from the GraphQL API

## Note

I tried to keep the project as simple as possible, focusing on the main requirements of the challenge.

Possible improvements:

- Routing type safety,
- Add more granular error handling,
- UI design,
- UX (ex: navigating back to the discover page when deeply nested in the details page),
- Abstract redundant code into custom hooks/components,

## Run the project

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Run the tests
