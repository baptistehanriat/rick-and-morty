## Introduction

Hey there üëã,

This is my submission to the [Perdoo Code Challenge](https://www.notion.so/Full-Stack-Web-Engineer-Case-Study-1df14966419740c2baf95461c04458c8).

I tried to keep things simple and focus on the main requirements of the challenge in order to stay within the 3-4 hours suggested.

I would be happy to discuss the project with you and get your feedback.

### üìà Improvements:

In a real project, we could consider the following improvements:

- **Add more granular error handling:** right now we only show a generic error message but it woul be better to show specific error messages depending on the error type,
- **Add more tests:** Only the Pagination component and the global navigation are being tested. We could add more tests to the other components and pages, **focusing on the data fetching** (see https://docs.cypress.io/guides/end-to-end-testing/working-with-graphql)
- **Better UI and UX:** example: allow user to navigating back to the discover page when he's deeply nested in the detailed info pages,
- **Add routing type safety**

### üõ†Ô∏è Stack

This project was built using the following stack:

- NextJS 14 (with app directory),

- Apollo Client for fetching data from the GraphQL API,
- Jest for unit tests,
- Cypress for end-to-end tests.
